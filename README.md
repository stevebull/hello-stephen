It's 3:25 pm and I have 5 more minutes to add to my story.

I was able to clone this repository to my MacBook Pro, and then I was able to use 'git pull origin' in my MBP to update this README.md file, I made cahnges to README.md using vi editor, I was challanged for user name and pw when I attempted 'git push origin', and I did not see a change to https://github.com/stevebull/hello-stephen/edit/master/README.md when I returned to web interface.

ok - - i found some info about using 'git reset --hard origin/your_branch' to get the new version https://github.com/stevebull/hello-stephen/edit/master/README.md (master). Now let's see I can send it back from remote to Internet site.

#GOOD NEWS
I've got files going back-n-forth between Internet git and remote git.
